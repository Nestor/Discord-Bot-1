# Hello!

Thank you for viewing the source code, keep in mind **"Latest Episode"** means *the last time the file was modified*.


# Please Read:

Plexi Development heavily relies on **YouTube Watch Time**, without it we risk **losing our YouTube Partnership**, if you would like to help, **please keep the videos running in the background** *(even with the volume muted)*. 

**Want to help even more?** Let [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6GHblKh3XA&list=PLL9m5KjtRdzAubBDuYU6Rq7_OMvoS9zA7) playlist run in the background, you can have it muted as well!
